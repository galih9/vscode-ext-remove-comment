# ðŸ§© VSCode Tetris: A Webview Experiment

Ever wondered how far VS Code webview extensions can go? This project answers that question by bringing a classic game directly into your editor!

**VSCode Tetris** is an extension built primarily for **educational purposes**. It demonstrates the capabilities and potential of VS Code's webview API by embedding a fully functional Tetris game.

The core Tetris game logic was developed by [Rich East](https://codepen.io/REast) and is based on their original work found on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/REast/pen/bGMyqP).
